    - Add ".venv" and ".env" (into a newline) 
    - Save the ".gitignore" file.
    - Create ".env" file
      Usually the .env file contains our local development secret information link to our account. E.g. API_KEY, Password. We don't share with anyone.

     something like this:
     git remote add origin https://github.com/lcheewoei/python-weather.git
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     Copy all 3 commands and go to python terminal right click, to paste line by line and hit <ENTER>

     https://www.render.com
     If  you don't have account, can sign up for free.
     Link the render account to my github account and authorize the access.
     It will pull these files from our github repository into render.com
     - In render.com dashboard, after successfully login, go to create new web services
     - You will see a list of your github repository, connect the "python-weather" from github to the service.
     - Then configure the web service like Name.
